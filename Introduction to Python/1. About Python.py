# 1. About Python
"""
“Python has gotten sufficiently weapons grade that we don’t descend into R anymore. Sorry, R people. I used to be one of you but we no longer descend into R.” – Chris Wiggins

# 1.1. Overview
"""
In this lecture we will

   a. outline what Python is

   b. compare it to some other languages

   c. showcase some of its abilities.

At this stage, it’s not our intention that you try to replicate all you see.

We will work through what follows at a slow pace later in the lecture series.

Our only objective for this lecture is to give you some feel of what Python is, and what it can do.
