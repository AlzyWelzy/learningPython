# 1. About Python
"""
“Python has gotten sufficiently weapons grade that we don’t descend into R anymore. Sorry, R people. I used to be one of you but we no longer descend into R.” – Chris Wiggins
"""

# 1.1. Overview
"""
In this lecture we will

   a. outline what Python is

   b. compare it to some other languages

   c. showcase some of its abilities.

At this stage, it’s not our intention that you try to replicate all you see.

We will work through what follows at a slow pace later in the lecture series.

Our only objective for this lecture is to give you some feel of what Python is, and what it can do.

# 1.2. What is Python?
"""
Python is a general-purpose programming language conceived in 1989 by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum.

Python is free and open source, with development coordinated through the Python Software Foundation.

Python has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one of the most popular programming languages.
"""

# 1.2.1. Common Uses
"""
Python is a general-purpose language used in almost all application domains such as

    communications

    web development

    CGI and graphical user interfaces

    game development

    resource planning

    multimedia, data science, security, etc., etc., etc.

Used and supported extensively by Internet services and high-tech companies including

    Google

    Netflix

    Meta

    Dropbox

    Amazon

    Reddit

For reasons we will discuss, Python is particularly popular within the scientific community and behind many scientific achievements in

    Space Science

    Particle Physics

    Genetics

and practically all branches of academia.

Meanwhile, Python is also very beginner-friendly and is found to be suitable for students learning programming and recommended to introduce computational methods to students in fields other than computer science.

Python is also replacing familiar tools like Excel as an essential skill in the fields of finance and banking.
